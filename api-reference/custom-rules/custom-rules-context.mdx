title: 'Context for Custom rules API'
description: 'Why I included this set of docs'
---

I included this set of API documentation because it particularly highlights my experience working with OAS.  Originally, the engineers had the API docs as one help article where parameters, responses, and descriptions were all organized into tables or were presented as JSON objects. To create a more usable, dynamic, and interactive API experience for our users, I converted that documentation into OAS.

This documentation is available [publicly today](https://docs.humansecurity.com/applications-and-accounts/reference/getcustomrules), so I did not redact anything in my samples.
