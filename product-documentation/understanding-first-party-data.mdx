description: An article describing what first-party data is and why it's beneficial for users
---

<Accordion title="Why I included this article">A conceptual article explaining what first-party data is and how it was used to an influencer’s benefit when they connected their social network accounts to the company, referred to as Acme. It was assumed that most content creators were not familiar with first-party data at all, and that they were cautious about giving away first-party data because they didn’t know what that entailed. This article aimed to demystify first-party data and convince influencers they should give first-party permissions to Acme.<br /><br />This article was challenging because, while it was important to the business to have information about first-party data readily available, it is an intimidating concept for most readers. Many users value their data privacy and often want to know how their data is being used. In this case, not only did I need to explain what it meant to share first-party data, but I needed to encourage influencers to do so, as they needed to connect their social network accounts for their collaborating brands to see their engagement rates and other profile statistics.<br /><br />Certain identifying information about the company, as well as certain product information, has been redacted from this article.</Accordion>

## Understanding first-party data

**First-party data** is user data collected with permission directly from users on websites and applications based on how they interact with the platform. This data is called “first-party” because businesses get the data straight from their users. In Acme’s case, we receive first-party data from your connected **social networks.** These networks share data with Acme to display information about your posts and feeds. These include:

* Your content
* Content metrics
* Your audience demographic information where available, such as gender

Social networks can only share this data with Acme with your permission. Acme does not receive permission to:

* Share information about your collaborations with marketers you do not work with, including payout or terms information
* Access your account passwords
* Post on your behalf
* View your private messages

In contrast, **third-party data** is acquired without a direct relationship between the business and the user whose data is being collected. Third-party data is bought and sold through a marketplace or exchange—sometimes without your permission. Because of this, using third-party data creates privacy concerns for users.

You can learn more about how Acme works with your first-party data below.

### Benefits of first-party data

There are a variety of benefits to using first-party data rather than third-party data for both you, the content creator, and your collaborating marketer. One of the most important benefits is that first-party data is collected straight from the source—which, in this case, are you and your social network accounts. With first-party data, the content and metrics Acme shares to your marketers will be as up-to-date and accurate as possible. This ensures you’ll be reimbursed for your work, as well as builds trust between you and the brand you’re working with. Marketers that can rely on precise metrics are also more likely to collaborate with you again. In contrast, using third-party data has a risk of being outdated or inaccurate.

A second benefit is that using first-party data allows you to control who can access your data. The practice of collecting third-party data from users and selling that data has raised a variety of privacy concerns. By leveraging first-party data, you can feel more secure about your privacy as well as be assured that your information goes straight to your brand without any middlemen in between. This means you won’t have to worry about others buying and selling your data without your knowledge—and potentially profiting off of it without your consent.

### Using first-party data with Acme

To take advantage of first-party data, you need to connect each of your social network accounts. The process to get your permission is different for each network. For some, Acme only needs your username, and we’ll get permission directly from the social network to access your content and metrics. For others, you’ll need to grant permission yourself by **authenticating** your accounts.

**Authentication** means that you’ll need to provide your username and also go through an additional, secure process confirming that Acme has your permission to collect your data. During this process, you typically need to accept one or more permissions. You **must** accept **all permissions** that appear during the authentication process; these are the minimum permissions Acme needs to sync your content, stats, and information.

If a social network does require you to authenticate, then your content and metrics from that network won’t appear in Acme or to your collaborating brand until you do, even if you provide your username. We **highly recommend** you authenticate so all your posts and metrics seamlessly sync for your marketers.

If you don’t authenticate, you’ll need to manually upload your content, captions, and stats each time you want to submit a deliverable.
