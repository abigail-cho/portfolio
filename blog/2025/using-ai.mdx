With the rise of accessible AI in the workplace, the tech writing community has been stricken with the idea that our jobs might be taken over by LLMs. And, to be fair, this might be true for organizations that don't value what good technical writers bring to the table beyond "just" writing: the ability to get into the perspective of a user. 

But I think that this fear is overstated, and that AI is just another tool—and an excellent one at that—to automate and accelerate tech writing tasks just as much as any other technology out there. However, it's a matter of figuring out how to use it effectively. I've been trying to use it more in my day-to-day just to get used to it in my workflow, and recently, I had a great opportunity to really get AI to do a lot of the hefty work for me. 

## A tale of outdated docs

As part of a docs overhaul I was doing, I came across an article instructing users on how to send data from our product to Google Analytics. To complete this integration, users needed to add Google Analytics events to our proprietary script. These events would then send data to GA.

The problem I encountered—and one that every technical writer knows well—was that the docs and code samples were about 90% relevant for **only** Universal Analytics (UA). For those that don't know, UA was a previous version of Google Analytics, but it was completely by Google Analytics 4 (GA4) on **July 1, 2024.** In other words, 90% of the article I found hadn't been relevant for over a year.

Luckily, we hadn't had customer escalations about this, otherwise I would've noticed this a lot earlier, but the fact remained that this article—or at least the code samples—had to be completely rewritten to work with GA4. *Alright,* I thought, *I'll ask around the engineering team and see if anyone can help me with this.* 

Unfortunately, I encountered a second age-old technical writing problem: I kept getting passed around from SME to SME until I finally concluded that, if anyone *did* know the implementation details to send our data to GA4, they no longer worked at our company.

## Taking fate into my own hands

I now found myself in an awkward position: I needed to fix these docs, but I didn't have the expertise or access to code a solution myself, and the individuals that did would need to commit bandwidth to figure out a solution themselves. In the midst of a development sprint, I knew this was definitely asking too much. 

In the olden days, this would've been the end of the road for this issue. Barring teaching myself JavaScript and custom Google Analytics commands—which I would never do, because there were a lot of better ways to spend my time—there was no way for me to complete this on my own. On the flip side, the SMEs that could help me couldn't realistically prioritize this because it wasn't affecting customers (yet)—it was "just" an outdated article I happened to come across.
