Before the new year, I helped our team hire a second technical writer. Based on the hiring process and questions I received during my interview process for the first technical writer role, I knew that I had to be involved in this one!

My company fell prey to what a lot of non-tech writers fall prey to: assuming that a technical writer needs to be an expert in the field. Typically, I've found that whenever I interview for lone writer or solo writer positions, I'm being interviewed by people that don't know anything about technical writing. So, they end up asking me about the industry instead, and how much experience I have about their industry. I usually have to spend time convincing them that, even if they don't hire me, they shouldn't necessarily hire a tech writer based on industry knowledge. That's what a SME is for! Instead, they should consider it more like a customer success role: what would you bring to the user experience? 

Indeed, if technical writing was primarily about being an expert in the industry, then any SME would likely be qualified to be a technical writer. And don't get me wrong&mdash;having experience in the field you're writing in can help! But believing that's a prerequisite is incorrect thinking. I personally didn't know much about either industry I've worked in so far (influencer marketing and cybersecurity&mdash;super closely related, I know), but I believe this only helped me. This is because the audiences for the documentation **also** were non-experts, which meant that starting on their level helped me see their perspective. 

I think this is the pitfall of having an expert write the documentation: they forget what the user doesn't know because they know so much&mdash;as they should! The SME's entire job is to know their area inside and out. But the deeper you go, the farther from the start you are, and the less you remember of what it was like to be a beginner&mdash;or worse, a frustrated, annoyed individual who's reading the docs just to get a task done and **not** because they genuinely want to learn about machine-learning models.

So, when my manager&mdash;who had never managed a technical writer, much less a team of them, before me&mdash;mentioned he was going to start the process to hire a second tech writer, I told him I would be happy to participate if he'd let me. I knew I'd be part of the interview panel, but I wasn't initially part of the screening process&mdash;something I was keen on getting in on because I was worried my colleagues might accidentally reject someone based on incorrect assumptions. Unfortunately, I wasn't involved at the very start, but thankfully, my manager could sense something was amiss, because he started sending me resumes of some of the candidates that made it through the recruiter. 

...And it was only resumes. And when I looked at them, there weren't any obvious links to portfolios either. Now, resumes are important, but I think many technical writers would agree that some demonstration of your writing ability in the form of a portfolio is equally important. I personally don't like judging So, I went back to my manager, hoping it was a mistake and he just forgot to give them to me. 

Unfortunately, he didn't forget. Actually, they hadn't been asking for them in the application process. Cue internal screaming. 

Once I found that out, I sat down with my manager and really told him my opinion on how they should conduct the interview process&mdash;not necessarily with me directly embedded into it, but at least keep a few things in mind.

* Resumes aren't enough for technical writing applications. We need examples of each person's writing to see if they'll be a good fit. 
* Good technical writers don't need to be industry experts. Instead, they need to know the right questions to ask. 

Thankfully, he took this to heart, and a few days later, he started passing on different portfolios of work from applicants. There was also a distinct difference in how he was observing each applicant and their work. For example, one of the applicants sent a link to a knowledge base they'd put together from scratch. This was impressive, but
