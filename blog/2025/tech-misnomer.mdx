title: "The 'technical' writer technicality"

Recently, I got involved with hiring a second technical writer for our product team. Unfortunately, when I jumped in, I found that my company fell prey to something I think is common for non-tech writers: they assumed that a technical writer needs to be an expert in the field they're writing in. Thankfully, I came in and convinced my manager that it didn't have to be that way.

## Technically, we don't have to be "technical"

I think a lot of tech writers have encountered this misconception that we need to be industry experts first and writers second&mdash;I know I have, especially for smaller teams! Typically, whenever I interview for solo writer positions, my interviewers ask how much I know about their industry. I usually have to spend time convincing them that, even if they don't hire me, they shouldn't necessarily hire a tech writer based on industry knowledge&mdash;that's what SMEs are for! Instead, they should consider it more like a customer success role and ask me something like: what would you bring to our users' experiences? 

Honestly, if technical writing was primarily about being an expert in the industry, then any SME would likely be qualified to be a technical writer. The SME's entire job is to know their area inside and out, but the deeper you go, the farther from the start you are, and the less you remember of what it was like to be a beginner&mdash;or worse, a frustrated, annoyed individual who's reading the docs just to get a task done and **not** because they genuinely want to learn about how the backend architecture of our app is actually structured or something. 

Now, don't get me wrong&mdash;having experience in the field you're writing in can definitely help, especially if you're writing for other experts. But believing that's a hard prerequisite for **all** tech writing roles is wrong. I personally didn't know much about either industry I've worked in (influencer marketing and cybersecurity&mdash;super closely related, I know), but I believe this only helped me. This is because the audiences for the documentation **also** were non-experts, which meant that starting on their level helped me write for **their** perspective&mdash;and ultimately, the user is key! 

## A bumpy start

I apparently did well convincing my interview panel that tech writers didn't need to be experts, because I got a new role in a new industry that was mostly unfamiliar. Unfortunately, I lost some of the work I did with those individuals because I ended up getting a new manager from outside that panel. This manager had never managed a technical writer before me, so I ended up teaching him quite a bit about it. I didn't mind doing this, and I was actually used to it, but it did mean he didn't know what to look for in technical writing candidates. 

From the start, I knew I'd be part of the interview panel, but I wasn't initially part of the screening process. I really wanted to get involved because I was worried we might turn away potential candidates on misplaced assumptions. Still, I was relatively new myself&mdash;I hadn't even been at the company a year yet&mdash;so I tread lightly and simply asked for regular updates on how the search was going. 

Luckily, while he wasn't a tech writing expert, my manager had good instincts. Based on the candidates that made it to him, he could sense something was amiss with the process. He started sending me resumes to get my opinion ahead of scheduling any interviews. 

I remember that, when I got the first resume, it looked like it was someone with a heavy technical background. The resume's format was also inconsistent and there were some small grammar mistakes. Still, I didn't want to reject someone from a writer role just for those&mdash;like I said earlier, having technical expertise can help&mdash;so I asked to see this person's portfolio too. After all, it's hard to judge someone's for a writing position without seeing their past work. 

"Great point," my manager replied to me. "I'll ask if this person sent one." 

"Great üòÅ," I Slacked back, internally screaming. Did that mean we hadn't been asking for portfolios as part of the application?

Unfortunately, when he got back to me, I learned that, yes, that's what it meant. And we hadn't planned to have a writing exercise portion either, which I think is an acceptable replacement (better than nothing, at least). This by itself made me ready to give a lot of feedback, but then my manager also added, "It's also been really hard to find someone that's in our industry. Even this candidate hasn't worked in our field before."

Okay, so maybe this warranted a longer discussion.

## It's time for The Talk

Once I found out that:

* We were only looking for writers with expert knowledge in our field already, and
* We weren't asking for portfolios or writing samples in the application

I knew I had to sit down with my manager and at least tell him my opinion. I wasn't sure if I would be able to change anything directly, but just from finding out those two points, I strongly felt that we were setting ourselves up for failure. We didn't have the right mindset to find a great technical writer candidate, and that would not only affect my personal day-to-day work, but it'd affect the company as a whole. This is because, in addition to keeping up our documentation, I needed a colleague that I could collaborate with to push forward technical writing initiatives like creating a new style guide, optimizing the knowledge base's SEO, and championing docs processes in the product cycle. I felt like I wouldn't be able to do this with someone that didn't have a proven, skilled technical writing background.

So, with these strong feelings, I took some time with my manager to tell him my opinions. I told him I wasn't necessarily asking to be more involved in the process (although I would've like that), but I at least wanted to make sure that he and the recruiter understood where I was coming from and what to look for. Thankfully, he took these to heart.

## Promising improvements

I was lucky that I had a manager that was open-minded and was willing to learn about technical writing. He came away from the conversation with a new perspective and promised he'd change up the hiring process.

A few days later, he made good on his promise. First, he started passing on actual portfolios as well as resumes to me. Second, he was sending me his thoughts on the portfolios, and what he said told me he was trying to think about what makes good documentation, even though he wasn't a documentarian himself. For example, one of the applicants sent a knowledge base they'd put together from scratch. By itself, this is impressive, but when my manager shared this link with me, he said, "I'm curious to hear what you think about this. There's something about it I can't quite put my finger on, and I'm not sure if it's just me."

After taking a look myself, it was clear what was giving him pause. While all the articles didn't break any English rules and were technically correct, they  were hard to read&mdash;and not just because the topics were very technical. Instead, I believe the problem was that a lot of articles were very information-heavy in the beginning and didn't get to the point until late into the article. For example, procedural articles didn't start their steps until the last third of the article, while reference articles didn't clearly tell me the point or "why" until somewhere halfway down the page. These are things that I try to avoid as a tech writer because, as evidenced by my manager, while they might not be easy for readers to describe, having these problems really does make their experience harder. 

Once I went back to him with this analysis and affirmed his initial hesitance, I think he really understood why I insisted we changed the hiring criteria for the role. While this candidate was clearly technical and likely an expert in their own right, this expertise didn't translate into good documentation. 

After this, my manager looped me into the screening process just so he could doubly make sure we were doing it right&mdash;but honestly, they probably didn't need me. They took my feedback really well and started picking out some really solid candidates, regardless of their specific expertise in our team's industry. I was mostly just there to confirm their choices were on the right track&mdash;and they often were! 

## Happy endings

Eventually, we ended up hiring a great second tech writer, and at the end of it, my manager thanked me for voicing my opinion and changing his views. He willingly admitted he didn't know a lot about technical writing, so he said that what I shared was really helpful and something he could keep in mind for the future. So all in all, a positive experience! 

To sum it up: don't let the "technical" part of the Technical Writer title fool you&mdash;some of the best technical writers **aren't** experts in their own right. What makes a tech writer great is not their depth of knowledge in a subject, but their ability to learn and ask enough questions to learn **just enough** to explain it to your users. Don't make this mistake and accidentally turn away great tech writers from your door!
