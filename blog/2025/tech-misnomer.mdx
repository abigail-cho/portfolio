title: "The 'technical' writer technicality"

Recently, I got involved with hiring a second technical writer for our product team. Unfortunately, when I jumped in, I found that my company fell prey to something I think is common for non-tech writers: they assumed that a technical writer needs to be an expert in the field they're writing in. Thankfully, I came in and convinced my manager that it didn't have to be that way.

## Technically, we don't have to be..."technical"

I think a lot of tech writers have encountered this misconception that we need to be industry experts first and writers second&mdash;I know I have, especially for smaller teams! Typically, whenever I interview for solo writer positions, my interviewers ask how much I know about their industry. I usually have to spend time convincing them that, even if they don't hire me, they shouldn't necessarily hire a tech writer based on industry knowledge&mdash;that's what SMEs are for! Instead, they should consider it more like a customer success role and ask me something like: what would you bring to our users' experiences? 

Honestly, if technical writing was primarily about being an expert in the industry, then any SME would likely be qualified to be a technical writer. The SME's entire job is to know their area inside and out, but the deeper you go, the farther from the start you are, and the less you remember of what it was like to be a beginner&mdash;or worse, a frustrated, annoyed individual who's reading the docs just to get a task done and **not** because they genuinely want to learn about how the backend architecture of our app is actually structured or something. 

Now, don't get me wrong&mdash;having experience in the field you're writing in can definitely help, especially if you're writing for other experts. But believing that's a hard prerequisite for **all** tech writing roles is wrong. I personally didn't know much about either industry I've worked in (influencer marketing and cybersecurity&mdash;super closely related, I know), but I believe this only helped me. This is because the audiences for the documentation **also** were non-experts, which meant that starting on their level helped me write for **their** perspective&mdash;and ultimately, the user is key! 

## A bumpy start

I apparently did well convincing my interview panel that tech writers didn't need to be experts, because I got a new role in a new industry that was mostly unfamiliar. Unfortunately, 

## Promising improvements

## Happy endings


So, when my manager&mdash;who had never managed a technical writer, much less a team of them, before me&mdash;mentioned he was going to start the process to hire a second tech writer, I told him I would be happy to participate if he'd let me. I knew I'd be part of the interview panel, but I wasn't initially part of the screening process&mdash;something I was keen on getting in on because I was worried my colleagues might accidentally reject someone based on incorrect assumptions. Unfortunately, I wasn't involved at the very start, but thankfully, my manager could sense something was amiss, because he started sending me resumes of some of the candidates that made it through the recruiter. 

...And it was only resumes. And when I looked at them, there weren't any obvious links to portfolios either. Now, resumes are important, but I think many technical writers would agree that some demonstration of your writing ability in the form of a portfolio is equally important. I personally don't like judging So, I went back to my manager, hoping it was a mistake and he just forgot to give them to me. 

Unfortunately, he didn't forget. Actually, they hadn't been asking for them in the application process. Cue internal screaming. 

Once I found that out, I sat down with my manager and really told him my opinion on how they should conduct the interview process&mdash;not necessarily with me directly embedded into it, but at least keep a few things in mind.

* Resumes aren't enough for technical writing applications. We need examples of each person's writing to see if they'll be a good fit. 
* Good technical writers don't need to be industry experts. Instead, they need to know the right questions to ask. 

Thankfully, he took this to heart, and a few days later, he started passing on different portfolios of work from applicants. There was also a distinct difference in how he was observing each applicant and their work. For example, one of the applicants sent a link to a knowledge base they'd put together from scratch. This was impressive, but there was something about the content that, while my manager couldn't put his finger on it, he was unsure about it for some reason. 

After taking a look at it myself, it was clear to me that he was probably noticing that, while the articles were written well and didn't break any English rules, the way they were written were hard to read, even for an expert audience. There was a lot of superfluous information at the beginning of the article, not a lot of obvious goals, and the actual procedures for some articles didn't start until the last third of the page. As a technical writer, I knew that these were things that make it harder for readers to actually get through an article, and my manager as a non-writer also sensed that, even though he couldn't put it into words. 

After I explained these reasons to him, I think he really understood what I meant by my earlier points. Just because you're an expert and you happen to write pretty well doesn't mean you're a great technical writer automatically. It was clear, for example, that this candidate was very technical and knew a lot about software development, but there were aspects of his writing that he could've improved by putting the user first. 

After this, he went back to the recruiter and relayed what I told him&mdash;and even better, they looped me into the screening process so they could make sure they were doing it right. But honestly, they probably didn't need me; they took my feedback really well and started picking out some really solid candidates, regardless of their specific expertise in our team's industry. 

Eventually, we ended up hiring a great second tech writer, and at the end of it, my manager thanked me for voicing my opinion and changing his views. He willingly admitted he didn't know a lot about technical writing, so he said that what I shared was really helpful and something he could keep in mind for the future. So all in all, a positive experience! 

So to sum it up: don't let the "technical" part of the Technical Writer title fool you&mdash;some of the best technical writers **aren't** experts in their own right. What makes a tech writer great is not their depth of knowledge in a subject, but their ability to learn and ask enough questions to learn **just enough** to explain it to your users. Don't make this mistake and accidentally turn away great tech writers from your door!
